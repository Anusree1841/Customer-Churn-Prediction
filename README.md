# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Churn is a one of the biggest problem in the telecom industry. Churners are people who leave 
a company’s service for some reasons. Companies face problem when coming to realising the 
problems faced by the customers. To stay in the market competition of today’s world, all the 
telecom industry have to analyse the reason for the customers churn. For that they have to 
determine the factors related to the churners. The main motive of this study is to provide the 
telecom companies an easy and effective way to predict customers who are going to churn.
Customer churn prediction will help the company to save their customers from changing their 
service. In this proposed model, we are trying to predict whether a customer will change the 
company’s service to another company using some of the factors related to the customer. We 
are using Logistic regression and ANOVA for this model. The results are measured using 
different criterias.
